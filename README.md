# Grocery-Store-WebApp
Designed a large scale interactive web app that supports working of an online grocery store where customers, employees, managers and guests can authenticate, view/edit records, place/cancel purchases and do more relevant functions as per the position. Used Java for backend and SQL for querying the relational database. In this project, I optimized the performance of the App by about 30-40% using Java Server Pages (JSP) over PHP to establish JDBC Connection with MySQL database and design all the front-end. Also, enhanced the database search by adding Normalization features (3rd and 4th Normal Form).


How to Run:
    - Keep the WEB-INF and WebApp folder at path
          tomcat/webapps/ROOT
    - Open Browser and go to localhost:8080/WebApp/welcome.jsp
